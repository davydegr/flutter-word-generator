# namer_app

A very basic Flutter application, built to learn the basics of both Flutter and Dart.

This application generates a random word that is a combination of two other random words. The favorite combinations can be favourited and viewed in the favourites tab.

Everything was built with the guidance of the Flutter interactive Lab that is provided in their documentation.
